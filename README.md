# Spam-and-ham-NLP-Project
The SMS Spam Classification project employs a systematic approach to effectively differentiate between legitimate and spam messages. The project encompasses five key steps, starting with Data Preprocessing, where raw SMS text data is meticulously cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into a format suitable for subsequent analysis. Feature Engineering follows, involving the extraction of pertinent attributes from the text data to enhance content representation.

In Model Selection, a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is chosen for its suitability in text classification tasks. The classifier is then trained using a labeled dataset. The Training and Evaluation phase assesses the model's performance using diverse metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results reveal its ability to achieve an impressive accuracy of 97%.

The final step, Visualizing Results, employs a confusion matrix to present the model's predictions graphically. This matrix visually breaks down the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, aiding in understanding the model's strengths and limitations. In sum, this project highlights the effectiveness of the chosen methodology in accurately categorizing SMS messages as spam or not. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, trained on appropriately preprocessed data, demonstrates its prowess in text classification, achieving an accuracy of 97%, a result that is visually reinforced through the confusion matrix representation.
